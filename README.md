Mapping Civil War battlefields and casualties

## Background

This analysis was inspired by a recent trip to the [Gettysburg National Military Park](https://www.nps.gov/gett/index.htm). We experienced a wonderful history lesson through one of the park's [Licensed Battlefield Guides](http://gettysburgtourguides.org/). This trip piqued my interest in mapping the path of the American Civil War. 

The theme for my map is a replication of Timo Grossenbacher's beautiful visualization of [Switzerland's regional demographics](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2016/12/beautiful-thematic-maps-with-ggplot2-only/). The idea behind the theme is to highlight the data with minimal visual distractions.
